## Overview
This repository contains all the scripts and resources required to reproduce the simulation results presented in the manuscript. The study evaluates several techniques for PAPR (Peak-to-Average Power Ratio) reduction in OFDM systems, including:

- Neural Network (NN)-based approach
- PTS (Partial Transmit Sequence)
- MCSA (Memoryless Continuous Search Algorithm)
- DFT Spread

The performance of each method is assessed in terms of:
- **PAPR (Peak-to-Average Power Ratio)**
- **BER (Bit Error Rate)**
- **Computational complexity**
